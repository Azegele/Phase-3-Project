# Terry Traffic Stops

## Introduction

A (**Terry stop**) is a seizure under both state and federal law. A *Terry* stop is defined in policy as:


    A brief, minimally intrusive seizure of a subject based upon articulable reasonable
    suspicion in order to investigate possible criminal activity. The stop can apply to people
    as well as to vehicles. The subject of a *Terry* stop is not free to leave.
        
        
(**Reasonable suspicion**) requires:


    Specific, objective, articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences, would
    create a well-founded suspicion that there is a substantial possibility that a subject has
    engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in criminal conduct.
    
    
The reasonableness of the *Terry* stop is considered in view of the totality of the circumstances,
the officer’s training and experience, and what the officer knew before the stop. Information
learned during a stop can lead to additional reasonable suspicion or probable cause that a crime
has occurred, but cannot provide the justification for the original stop.
An officer may (**frisk**), or pat-down, the subject of a *Terry* stop when, under the totality of the
circumstances and reasonable conclusions drawn from the officer’s training and experience, the
officer has reasonable suspicion that the subject may be armed and presently dangerous. A frisk
is strictly limited to a search (generally a pat-down of outer clothing) necessary to the discovery
of weapons that may be used to harm the officer or others nearby.
